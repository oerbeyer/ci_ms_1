# Code Institute Milestone 1 - The Guitar Centre

I've chosen to redesign the website for my local guitar shop -- **The Guitar Centre**.

I chose this project for the following reasons:

+ I am a guitar music enthusiast and I am passionate about playing the guitar myself.

+ I love the my local guitar shop.

+ This is a real business with a real need for user centric frontend development.

+ The business has an existing website, but there is a need to enhance UX and UI design 
to reflect current standard and best practices. <br>All businesses should periodically 
review and if necessary enchance UX and UI design to maximise value for users.

+ The existing website provides a starting point for content and some UX and UI 
design might be worth retaining or incorporating. 
<br>This allows me to focus on applying UX and UI enhancements that drive value for users. 
<br>This makes it a very good candidate for the user centric frontend design section of 
this Code Institute Diploma course.

+ The existing website is a set of static webpages. 
<br>This makes it a very good candidate for the user centric frontend design section of 
this Code Institute Diploma course.
+ The responsiveness of the UX design is especially in need of enhancement.

## UX
___
 
This website is aimed at guitar players of various skill levels and anyone thinking of 
taking up playing the guitar.

The summary value drivers for the business and for customers (based on the user stories) are as follows:

### **Value drivers for the business** 

+ The website should support and enhance the business's brand which is passion for and 
expertise in all things guitar.
+ The website should generate email enquiries, facebook enquiries, phone calls and 
in-store visits.
+ The website should encourage repeat visits and contact from customers.
+ The website should render properly and responsively on smart phones, tablets (portrait) and laptops.
+ The website should clearly explain how the business is operating during Covid-19.

### **Value drivers for the customer**

+ The website should be attractive to and relevant for guitar players of various skill levels.
+ The website should be attractive to and relevant for someone who is thinking of taking up playing the guitar.
+ The website should allow the customer to find the relevant services without navigating away from the landing page.
+ The website should allow the customer to contact the business easily from any webpage in the website.
+ The website should be simple to navigate.
+ The website should have clear calls to action e.g. special offers.


### **User stories**
Please note that the following is **not** an ordered list of user stories. The **ID** is simply a 4 digit unique identifier. 
An ID starting with a 1 is a business user story. An ID starting with a 2 is a customer user story. 

The focus is on the customer, hence the larger number of customer user stories relative to business user stories in the list. 
However, it should be clear from reading the list that the two sets of user stories are consistent and mutually reinforcing.

An initial list of development items based on these user stories was created. 
Items were initially prioritised based on perceived business and customer value taking into account development dependencies. 
The list of development items is periodically updated, and priorities are reviewed and adjusted as necessary as I learn more 
about the user stories and as my UX knowledge grows during the project.

[TODO: Add links to the Githhub projects where I did the analysis of the existing website and the 5 planes]

### **Delivering value**

This project implements a simple, but elegant and responsive website for **The Guitar Centre**.

It is created with the future in mind. [TODO: Things that are greate about this website]


Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

___
## Features
___

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

___
## Technologies Used
___

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

___
## Testing
___

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
